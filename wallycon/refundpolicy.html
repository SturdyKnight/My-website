                  Thank you for choosing Wallycon as your preferred paid wallpaper application. We are committed to providing you with a high-quality product and exceptional user experience. Please take a moment to review our refund policy outlined below.
                  <br><br>
                  Eligibility for Refunds:
                  We understand that circumstances may arise where you may request a refund for your purchase. However, refunds will only be considered under the following conditions:
                  a. Technical Issues: If you experience significant technical difficulties with Wallycon that prevent the app from functioning as intended, and our support team is unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable time frame.
                  b. Unavailability of Promised Features: In the event that Wallycon fails to provide features or functionalities that were explicitly advertised or promised during the time of purchase.
                  <br><br>
                  Refund Process:
                  To request a refund, please contact our customer support team within 14 days of your original purchase date. You can reach us by submitting a support ticket through our website's dedicated support page. Please provide detailed information about the reason for your refund request.
                  <br><br>
                  Non-Refundable Transactions:
                  Once the transaction for Wallycon has been completed, refunds will not be granted except in the circumstances mentioned in Section 1. We encourage users to thoroughly evaluate the app's features, functionality, and compatibility with their devices before making a purchase.
                  <br><br>
                  No Refunds for Change of Mind:
                  Refunds will not be provided due to a change of mind or if you decide that you no longer wish to use Wallycon after completing the purchase. We advise you to carefully consider your decision before proceeding with the transaction.
                  <br><br>
                  Fair Usage:
                  Refunds are intended to address genuine issues with the app's performance or unmet promises. Multiple refund requests for the same purchase, without valid grounds, may be deemed as an abuse of our refund policy.
                  <br><br>
                  Discretionary Refunds:
                  In exceptional cases where we determine that a refund is justified, we reserve the right to provide a partial refund or credit instead of a full refund.
                  <br><br>
                  We encourage you to reach out to our customer support team for any technical issues or concerns you may have before considering a refund. Our dedicated team is here to assist you and ensure that you have a satisfactory experience with Wallycon.
                  <br><br>
                  Please note that this refund policy is subject to change at our discretion. Any updates or modifications will be communicated on our website.
                  <br><br>
                  Thank you for your understanding and support.
                  <br><br>Sincerely,<br>
